Proxy: Include the code and command required for running the Proxy.

cd Proxy/bin/
> node runProxy.js

The above command runs the proxy with default configurations.

> node runProxy.js -h

The above command shows the possible arguments you can use.

> node runProxy.js   proxy_write_path    /tmp/proxy  

The above command runs the proxy with the given write_path. Make sure the directory used for the write_path exists.

Proxy/bin/scripts:  These scripts are used for copying or deleting the files generated by running the proxy. The files are written in the proxy_write_path (see above).

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Proxy/node_modules/JSInstrument:  This is the library developed and used for instrumenting the JavaScript code.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Proxy/profilerLib.js : This is the profiler library sent to the client.

ProcessData:  This directory include the code of Reporter; the code used for analyzing the data
              received from the client and finding the leaked objects.

Examples:
The following command analyzes the data collected during execution of benchmarks:

> bash ProcessData/Analyze/runAll.sh


The following command analyzes the data collected during execution of web applications:
> bash ProcessData/Analyze/runAllWeb.sh

To see the result of analysis on data collected during the execution of Benchmarks:
> cd ProcessData/Analyze/Graph:


To see the result of analysis on data collected during the execution of web applications:
> cd ProcessData/Analyze/GraphWeb:

To generate the time-count graphs for all the allocation and reference site in a specific benchmark (pdf.js benchmark):
> bash ProcessData/Analyze/makeallcount.sh  ProcessData/Analyze/Graph/pdf

To generate the collective-staleness graphs for all the allocation and reference site in a specific benchmark (pdf.js benchmark):
> bash ProcessData/Analyze/makeallcdf.sh   ProcessData/Analyze/Graph/pdf


since the size of data for all cases would be very large (about 7G) only samples
are uploaded. More data could be provided upon request.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To see data collected while running LeakSpot during the execution of Benchmarks:
> cd Data/BenchmarkRepeat:


To see data collected while running LeakSpot during the execution of web applications:
> cd Data/OpenSourceWebApps  
> cd Data/WebApps:


since the size of Data for all cases would be very large (more than 17G) only samples
are uploaded. More data could be provided upon request.

visualizeVISJSLib: This is the library used for visualizing the allocation-site graph.

To do so, go to:
> open visualizeVISJSLib/DRAW/index.html in browser

enter the input files (node files and edges files as generated by the ProcessData
for each benchmark or web application) and then press "visualize Graph". The other 
inputs are optional.
