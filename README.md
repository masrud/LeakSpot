Proxy: Include the code and command required for running the Proxy.

cd Proxy/bin/
> node runProxy.js

The above command runs the proxy with default configurations.

> node runProxy.js -h

The above command Shows the possible arguments that you can use.

Example:
> node runProxy.js proxy_write_path  /tmp/proxy  

Runs the proxy with the given write_path, make sure the directory given for the write_path exists.

Proxy/bin/scripts:  These scripts are used for copying or deleting all the possible files generated by running the proxy. The files are written in the proxy_write_path (see above).

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Proxy/node_modules/JSInstrument:  This is the library developed and used for instrumenting the JavaScript code.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Proxy/profilerLib.js : It is the profiler library sent to the client.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

ProcessData:  Include the code used in Reporter for analyzing the data
              received from the client and finding the leaked objects.

Examples:
> bash ProcessData/Analyze/makeallcount.sh  ProcessData/Analyze/Graph/pdf
> bash ProcessData/Analyze/makeallcdf.sh   ProcessData/Analyze/Graph/pdf
> bash makeAllFigures  Graph

To analyze the results of benchmarks run the following command
> bash ProcessData/Analyze/runAll.sh


To analyze the results of web applications run the following command
> bash ProcessData/Analyze/runAllWeb.sh

ProcessData/Analyze/Graph:
Contains the data collected while running LeakSpot during the execution of Benchmarks.

ProcessData/Analyze/GraphWeb:
Contains the data collected while running LeakSpot during the execution of WebApplication.


since the size of Data for all cases would be very large (about 7G) only samples
are uploaded. More data could be provided upon request.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Data/BenchmarkRepeat13Times:

Contains the data collected while running LeakSpot during the execution of Benchmarks.

Data/OpenSourceWebApps  and Data/WebApps:

Contains the data collected while running LeakSpot during the execution of web applications.

since the size of Data for all cases would be very large (more than 17G) only samples
are uploaded. More data could be provided upon request.

visualizeVISJSLib: visualize the allocation-site graph.

To do so, go to:
/home/masoomeh/Research/DevelopedTools/SPE/LeakSpot/visualizeVISJSLib/DRAW/index.html

enter the input files (node files and edges files as generated by the ProcessData
for each benchmark or web application) and then press "visualize Graph". The other 
inputs are optional.
