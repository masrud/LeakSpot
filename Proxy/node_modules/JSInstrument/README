This is the library developed for instrumenting the JavaScript code.
It is used in LeakSpot.

There are example of how to use the library in Test directory. 
generateAST.js generate the AST tree before and after instrumentation and
instrumentFile.js instruments a js file.


The instrumenter writes the the beautified version of each file in addition to
the modified one, so when digging into the code it will be easier to see what
is going on.
